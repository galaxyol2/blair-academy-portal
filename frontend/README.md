# Frontend

Static starter UI for a student portal dashboard (inspired by common university portal layouts like tile grids + widgets), ready to connect to backend auth.

## Run locally

- Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser (portal home), or
- Use any local static server (optional), e.g. `python -m http.server` from the `frontend/` folder.
