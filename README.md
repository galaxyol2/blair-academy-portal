# Blair Academy Portal

College/academy portal website project.

## Repo layout

- `backend/` API + auth + database
- `frontend/` web UI
- `docs/` project notes and decisions
- `infra/` deployment/dev infrastructure (compose, scripts, etc.)

## Getting started

Backend and frontend stacks aren’t locked in yet; pick the framework/tooling you want and wire it into the existing folders.
